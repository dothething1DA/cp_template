# A clone of KACTL

You can find the link to the original repo at https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl

(16th September 2024) everything in content/math and content/combinatorial is exactly the same as in the original repository. Everything related to Latex document processing also remain unchanged. Other than that, I changed most of the content to my own code. They are not micro optimmised, please consider carefully before using it in contest environment!
