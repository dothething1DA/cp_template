# A clone of KACTL

(24th March 2025)

You can find the link to the original repo at https://github.com/kth-competitive-programming/kactl

Everything in content/math and content/combinatorial is exactly the same as in the original repository. Everything related to Latex document processing also remain unchanged. Other than that, I changed most of the content to my own code for better understanding so that I can easily modify them during contest. They are not micro optimised, please consider carefully before using it in contest environment!
